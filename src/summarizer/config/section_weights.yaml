    weight: high
    max_tokens: 3500
    description: Business overview
    guidance: |-
      This is the Business section - the foundation for understanding the company.

      **CRITICAL: OPERATIONAL DRIVERS & GTM MECHANICS**
      Understanding the business means understanding how the numbers actually move:
      - Go-to-market model: Direct sales vs. channel vs. self-serve? Land-and-expand vs. enterprise deals?
      - Sales cycle: How long? What drives conversion? Who's the buyer (IT, CFO, line of business)?
      - Customer acquisition: What does it cost to get a new customer? How is marketing spent?
      - Customer expansion: How do existing customers grow? Upsell/cross-sell mechanics?
      - Unit economics: Revenue per customer/user, gross margin by product, contribution margin
      - Pricing model: Per-seat, consumption-based, enterprise license? Annual vs. monthly?
      - Capacity constraints: What limits growth? Hiring? Infrastructure? Regulatory approval?

      PRIORITIZE:
      - Business model: How does the company actually make money? Revenue streams, pricing power
      - Segment breakdown: Which business units drive growth vs. drag? Use tables for segment data
      - Competitive moat: What defensible advantages exist? (scale, network effects, IP, switching costs)
        - Market share trends: gaining, losing, or stable?
        - Pricing power evidence: can they raise prices?
        - Customer switching costs: quantified if possible
        - Network effects: real or marketing claims?
      - Market position: Market share, key competitors, industry dynamics
      - Customer concentration: Top customers, revenue dependency risks
      - Recent strategic changes: Acquisitions, divestitures, pivots, new products
      - Supply chain: Key suppliers, vertical integration, sourcing risks

      DE-PRIORITIZE:
      - Generic company history and founding story
      - Mission statements and corporate values
      - Standard industry background that applies to all competitors
      - Routine regulatory environment descriptions
  Item 1A:
    weight: high
    max_tokens: 2500
    description: Risk factors
    guidance: |-
      This is the Risk Factors section - but most risks are generic boilerplate.

      PRIORITIZE (company-specific, unusual, or quantified risks):
      - Risks unique to THIS company (not generic industry risks)
      - Newly added risks vs. prior filings (signals emerging concerns)
      - Risks with specific dollar amounts, percentages, or probabilities
      - Customer/supplier concentration risks with named parties
      - Regulatory risks specific to their products/markets
      - Key person dependencies (named executives)
      - Litigation risks with material exposure
      - Covenant or liquidity risks
      - Technology disruption specific to their business model

      DE-PRIORITIZE (generic boilerplate - mention briefly or skip):
      - FX/currency risk (standard for multinationals)
      - Interest rate risk (standard)
      - General cybersecurity risk (unless they've had breaches)
      - Generic macro/recession risk
      - "Competition is intense" (unless specific competitive threats named)
      - Standard pandemic/force majeure language
      - Generic regulatory risk without specific exposure
      - Boilerplate IP/patent risk

      FLAG EXPLICITLY: Any risk that mentions specific dollar thresholds, ongoing litigation,
      regulatory investigations, or material weaknesses.
  Item 7:
    weight: high
    max_tokens: 5000
    description: MD&A - management discussion
    guidance: |-
      This is MD&A - management's own narrative about performance. This is where you find
      the real story behind the numbers.

      **CRITICAL: FINANCIAL BREAKDOWN TABLES**
      Revenue and profit breakdowns are ESSENTIAL - preserve or recreate them as markdown tables:
      - Revenue by segment/business unit (with YoY growth %)
      - Revenue by geography/region (with YoY growth %)
      - Revenue by product/service line if disclosed
      - Gross profit by segment (with margins)
      - Operating income by segment (with margins)
      - Any other P&L breakdowns management provides

      These tables explain WHERE growth/decline is coming from - this is more valuable than narrative.

      **QUALITY OF EARNINGS ANALYSIS**
      Look beyond reported numbers to earnings quality:
      - Cash flow vs. earnings: Is net income converting to operating cash flow?
      - Working capital trends: DSO, inventory turns, DPO changes (cash conversion cycle)
      - Deferred revenue: Growing faster or slower than recognized revenue?
      - One-time items: Normalize for restructuring, litigation, impairments - what's the real run rate?
      - Stock-based compensation: Trend as % of revenue (real economic cost often ignored)
      - Capitalized costs: R&D capitalization, software development costs - aggressive or conservative?

      RED FLAGS to call out:
      - Net income growing faster than operating cash flow (earnings quality concern)
      - Rising DSO with flat/slowing revenue (collection issues)
      - Frequent "one-time" charges every year (not really one-time)
      - Heavy SBC (>15% of revenue for tech is concerning)

      **COMPARATIVE CONTEXT**
      Always anchor to prior periods:
      - What changed from last year? What drove the change?
      - Sequential trends: Acceleration, deceleration, or stability?
      - Is this performance in-line with history or an outlier?
      - Management commentary on guidance vs. actuals

      PRIORITIZE:
      - YoY and QoQ trends with specific drivers (not just "revenue increased")
      - Margin analysis: What's driving gross/operating margin changes?
      - Segment performance: Which units are growing/shrinking and why?
      - Forward-looking statements: Guidance, outlook, management expectations
      - Cash flow drivers: Working capital changes, CapEx plans, FCF trajectory
      - Capital allocation: Buybacks, dividends, M&A commentary
      - Key operating metrics: Same-store sales, ARR, churn, DAU, etc.
      - Management's explanation of misses or beats vs. expectations

      EXTRACT KEY METRICS (preserve exact numbers in tables where possible):
      - Revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income (and YoY %)
      - Gross margin, operating margin, net margin
      - Key segment revenues and growth rates
      - Guidance figures if provided
      - Any non-GAAP metrics management emphasizes

      DE-PRIORITIZE:
      - Lengthy accounting policy descriptions

      - Revenue by product/service type if disclosed
      - Gross profit and margin by segment

      The value of a quarterly report is understanding CHANGE:
      - vs. Prior Year Quarter: What drove YoY delta? Growth acceleration/deceleration?
      - vs. Prior Quarter (Sequential): Seasonal factors vs. real trend change?
      - vs. Guidance: Beat, miss, or in-line? Magnitude and driver?
      - vs. Prior Guidance: Did outlook improve or deteriorate? Why?
