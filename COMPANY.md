## Key Metrics (Enterprise Storage / Subscription SaaS)

### Revenue & Growth

- Total revenue and YoY growth
- Product revenue (hardware) vs Subscription services revenue
- Revenue mix shift toward subscription

### Subscription Metrics

- ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) - Evergreen subscription
- RPO (Remaining Performance Obligations)
- NRR (Net Revenue Retention)
- Subscription gross margin vs Product gross margin

### Profitability

- Non-GAAP operating margin
- Free cash flow
- Stock-based compensation (as % of revenue)
- GAAP vs Non-GAAP spread

### Competitive Position

- Win rates vs Dell, NetApp
- New customer additions
- FlashArray vs FlashBlade mix
- Geographic revenue split

## Investment Narrative (Short Thesis)

### 1. Valuation / Growth Deceleration

- Revenue growth slowing as flash array market matures
- Premium valuation multiple at risk of compression
- Subscription transition may mask underlying hardware weakness
- Comparison to peers (Dell, NetApp) on growth-adjusted basis

### 2. Technology Obsolescence Risk

- **NVMe-oF (NVMe over Fabrics)**: Commoditizing flash arrays
- **CXL (Compute Express Link)**: Potentially obsoletes traditional storage architecture
- **Cloud-native storage**: AWS EBS, Azure Disks, GCP Persistent Disk
- **Kubernetes-native storage**: Portworx (IBM), Longhorn, OpenEBS

### 3. Competitive Pressure

- Dell PowerStore aggressive pricing and bundling
- NetApp AFF with ONTAP software moat
- HPE Alletra modernization
- Hyperscaler native storage eroding on-prem TAM

### 4. Financial Concerns

- Heavy stock-based compensation
- Evergreen subscription economics (hardware refresh hidden in subscription)
- Customer concentration risk
- Gross margin trajectory as mix shifts
